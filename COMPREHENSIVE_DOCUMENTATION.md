# Library Management System - Comprehensive Documentation

## Overview

This is a full-stack library management system built with React/TypeScript frontend and Express/Node.js backend. The system provides complete digital library functionality including book management, user administration, borrowing system, activity logging, and real-time notifications.

## Recent Updates (Current Session)

### 1. Notification System ✅
**Implemented**: Complete announcement system for admin-to-user communication

**Features:**
- Admin can create system-wide announcements
- Real-time notification count display in header
- Modal-based notification interface with separate admin/user views
- Support for all languages and characters (UTF-8)
- Automatic notification polling every 30 seconds
- Mark notifications as read functionality

**Technical Implementation:**
- New `notifications` table in database with proper relations
- API endpoints: GET /api/notifications, POST /api/notifications/announcement, PUT /api/notifications/:id/read
- NotificationsModal component with admin creation and user viewing modes
- Updated header component with notification count badge
- Storage methods for notification management

**Database Schema Addition:**
```sql
notifications {
  id: serial PRIMARY KEY
  title: varchar(255) NOT NULL
  content: text NOT NULL
  type: varchar(50) DEFAULT 'announcement'
  created_by_id: varchar NOT NULL (FK to users)
  is_read: boolean DEFAULT false
  user_id: varchar (NULL for global announcements, FK to users for specific)
  created_at: timestamp DEFAULT now()
  updated_at: timestamp
}
```

### 2. Logout Redirect Fix ✅
**Issue**: Users saw 404 Page Not Found after logout and login instead of dashboard
**Root Cause**: After login success, users remained on `/login` path which doesn't exist in authenticated router
**Solution**: Added explicit navigation to dashboard (`setLocation("/")`) after successful login/registration
**Files Modified**: `client/src/pages/login.tsx` - added useLocation hook and navigation after auth success

### 3. Authentication Flow Improvements
- Fixed race condition by awaiting refetch() before navigation
- Proper session management and state updates
- Consistent redirect behavior for both login and registration

## System Architecture

### Database Design
**PostgreSQL with the following core tables:**
- `users` - User authentication and profile data
- `books` - Book catalog with availability tracking
- `borrowings` - Borrowing transactions and history
- `activity_logs` - System audit trail
